# Tensor Networks for Probabilistic Modeling

-------------------------------------

Harvesting the power of tensor networks to represent high-dimensional probability distributions as Matrix Product States. 

In this python package, we develop Matrix Product State (MPS) representations for probability distributions over all 
$2^n$ configurations of many-body systems of sites with a binary state space. The main applications are two-fold:

- In ``stochasticTN`` we use the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm to find steady state distribution of $2^n$-dimensional Markov generators.
- In ``spinmodelTN`` we construct MPS representations of the $2^n$ dimensional probability distributions of spin models with arbitrary higher-order interactions.

The MPS allows us to find efficient and accurate representations for the steady state distributions over all
$2^n$ configurations of the models. We can use this to efficiently compute observables, characterize the large deviation statistics and perform unbiased sampling of spin configurations.  

One example where we apply these methods is the SIS model of infectious disease spreading. We use this to study rare events, the large
deviation statistics and characterize the active-inactive phase transition using information measures in the following paper:

  > Wout Merbis, ClÃ©lia de Mulatier, Philippe Corboz
  > [arxiv/2305.06815](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06815)

We refer to there and the example notebook ``Examples.ipynb`` for more information on the large deviation statistics on the SIS model in one-dimension. In the notebook ``Network_example.ipynb`` we showcase an example based on using DMRG to find the non-equilibrium steady state of the SIS model on networks. 

## Repository contents

### stochasticTN

Code base for performing computations with Matrix Product State (MPS, sometimes called tensor trains) representations of large probability distributions. It is divided into several files.

#### `mps.py`
`mps.py` defines the MPS class for the stochasticTN package defining the MPS object with attributes:
- `.tensors` gives a list of the MPS tensors. All tensors are rank-3 tensors with index structure (left, physical, right).
- `.center` gives the location of the center node in the mixed canonical representation of the mps (all tensors to the left and right of 'center' are unitary matrices w.r.t. contraction from the left/right respectively)
- `.name` optional name for the mps
- `.bond_dimensions` gives a list of bond dimensions of the MPS
- `.physical_dimensions` gives a list of physical dimensions of the MPS
The MPS object is iterable, where iterating the MPS means iterating over MPS.tensors. Its length `len()` is defined as the number of sites in the MPS

`mps.py` contains many methods which are convenient for computations. Most notably:
- `.position(site)` moves the `mps.center` to the specified site by series of singular value decompositions. Specifying `normalize_SVs = True` rescales all singular values to form a distribution which sums to 1. Specifying `Dmax` or `cutoff` truncates the singular value spectrum to maximally `Dmax` SVs with magnitude above `cutoff`
- `.canonicalize()` puts the MPS in canonical form with respect to the left-most site (0) such that all tensors on the right are unitaries. Specifying `normalize_SVs = True` rescales all singular values to form a distribution which sums to 1. Specifying `Dmax` or `cutoff` truncates the singular value spectrum to maximally `Dmax` SVs with magnitude above `cutoff`
- `.norm()` returns the norm of the MPS. There are two protocols for computing the norm: `cx = 'stoch'` computes the $$L^1$$ norm (default), `cx = 'complex'` computes the $$L^2$$ norm for complex valued MPS tensors
- `.probabilties()` returns all $$2^n$$ probabilities as computed from the MPS, so this is exponentially costly. Raises a ValueError when `len(MPS)>28`
- `.save('name')` saves the MPS tensors and attributes in local folder "/MPSs/name/"
- `.sample_array()` returns an array sampled according to the probability distribution represented by the MPS

Additionally `mps.py` contains functions for creating some frequently used MPS objects. Most notably:

- `randomMPS(N, D)`: creates a random MPS of length `N` with maximal bond dimension `D`
- `occupied_mps(N,D)`: creates an MPS where all sites are in the occupied state
- `uniform_mps(N,D)`: creates an MPS representing the uniform distribution over all configurations
- `mps_from_array(array)`: creates an MPS with bond dimension 1 from an array of numbers between 0 and 1
- `loadMPS('name')`: loads an MPS from file which was saved using the `.save()` method

#### `mpo.py`

Here we define the MPO object for the stochasticTN package. It has as main attributes and methods:
- `MPO.tensors`: A list of MPS tensors with length N and index structure (left, down, up, right)
- `MPO.center`: Location of orthogonality site of the MPO. Can be moved with `MPO.position(site)`
- `MPO.bond_dimensions` list of local bond dimensions with length N + 1
- `MPO.physical_dimensions`: gives list of physical dimensions of the MPO
- `MPO.canonicalize()`: puts the MP) in canonical form with respect to the left-most site (0) such that all tensors on the right are unitaries. Specifying `normalize_SVs = True` rescales all singular values to form a distribution which sums to 1. Specifying `Dmax` or `cutoff` truncates the singular value spectrum to maximally `Dmax` SVs with magnitude above `cutoff`

It furthermore contains several functions to construct the MPO representation of various infinitesimal Markov generators or MPOs which are useful for computing observables when contracted with the MPS
- `SIS_MPO(N,r,s,driving, omega)`: constructs the Markov generator for the SIS process on a 1-dimensional lattice, Arguments are:
  - `N`: length of MPO
  - `r`: effective transmission rate between nearest-neighbors
  - `s`: tilting parameter for the dynamical activity
  - `driving`: driving protocol. Choose from 'boundary', 'right boundary', 'left boundary', 'absorbing', 'spontaneous'
  - `omega`: infection rate for the driving term
- `network_SIS(A,r,s,epsilon,cutoff)`: constructs the MPO for the SIS model on a network. Arguments:
  - `A`: network adjacency matrix as 2-dimensional array. Edge weights are accounted for such that the transmission probability is r*A[i,j] from nodes i to j and r*A[j,i] from node j to i
  - `r`: effective transmission rate between nearest neighbors
  - `s`: tilting parameter for the dynamical activity
  - `epsilon`: spontaneous infection rate
  - `cutoff`: optional size of minimal bond dimensions to keep when compressing the final MPO
- `occupancy_MPO(N)`: constructs an MPO of length `N` which projects on the occupied state. Its expectation value gives the expected number of occupied sites in the MPS
- `gapMPO(N,k)`: constructs an MPO of length `N` which projects on all configurations with `k` vacant sites in a row
- `project_on_k_infected(N,k)`: Builds an MPO of length `N` which projects on all configurations with `k` infected (occupied) sites
- `project_on_k_healthy(N,k)`: Builds an MPO of length `N` which projects on all configurations with `k` healthy (vacant) sites

#### `stochasticDMRG.py`

Defines the DMRG class used for running the DMRG algorithm which enables one to find the non-equilibrium steady state of Markov processes and to compute the scaled cumulant generating function for the dynamical activity in those processes as the leading eigenvalue of the tilted Markov generators.

The `DMRG` object itself is defined by specifying an `MPS` object to initiate the DMRG with and an `MPO` object whose leading eigenvector is sought in MPS form. Optionally, one can specify a left and right environment. The DMRG algorithm is run by calling:
- `DMRG.run_single_site_dmrg()` Runs the DMRG algorithm by optimizing single sites in the mps. Arguments are:
  - `MaxSweeps`: maximal number of sweeps
  - `accuracy`: Global accuracy as convergence criteria for the variance in energy
  - `tol`: Relative accuracy for local eigenvalues (stopping criterion) 
  - `Dmax`: maximal number of bond dimensions to keep per site
  - `cutoff`: maximal absolute value for the singular values, SVs below this value are dropped
  - `ncv`: The number of Lanczos vectors for the single site optimization
  - `verbose`: Boolean, if True will print the sweep results 

  Returns:
  - `energy`: eigenvalue of the MPO (returns the density if tilting parameter s=0)
  - `variance`: variance in the eigenvalue (returns variance in density if tilting parameter s=0)
  - `truncation_error`: size of the singular values discarded during the final sweep
  - `converged`: Boolean, returns True if the algorithm has converged, False otherwise

- `DMRG.run_double_site_dmrg()` Runs the DMRG algorithm by optimizing two adjacent sites in the mps at the same time. This allows for dynamical adjustment of the MPS bond dimensions. Argumments are the same as for the single site updates.

#### `operations.py`
This file contains several functions which are convenient for performing computations using the MPS and MPO. Most notably:

- `MPSMPOcontraction(mps, mpo)`: contracts the mps with an mpo site by site. Optionally performs truncation if `renormalize` is True. Overwrites mps with the contracted result. Specify `Dmax` and `cutoff` to truncate to a maximum of `Dmax` singular values with values above `cutoff`.
- `MPOMPOcontraction(mpo1, mpo2)`: contracts the mpo1 with mpo2 site by site. Optionally performs truncation if `renormalize` is True. Overwrites mps with the contracted result. Specify `Dmax` and `cutoff` to truncate to a maximum of `Dmax` singular values with values above `cutoff`.

- `find_permutation(L)`: returns the permutation which brings MPS into the optimal ordering. Based on the first Fielder vector of the graph Laplacian `L`.

#### `information_measures.py`

Collects various functions which compute information theoretic quantities from the MPS representation. It contains:
- `ShannonE(mps)`: computes the Shannon entropy of the complete distribution. Note that this is exponentially costly in the number of MPS sites so only use for small MPS (`n<28`)
- `mutual_information(mps, site)`: Computes the mutual information between the halves of the system, separated at `site`. Also exponentially costly as it uses the full distribution
- `singular_value_entropy(mps, site)`: computes the entropy of the singular value spectrum of the bond right of `site`. Use `method='square'` to get the entropy of the squares of the SVs (default), `method = 'linear'` gives the entropy of the SV distribution directly
- `second_Renyi_entropy(mps)`: computes the second Renyi entropy based on the MPS
- `second_Renyi_EE(mps,site)`: computes the second Renyi entanglement entropy across the bond to the right of `site`
- `second_Renyi_MI(mps,site)`: Computes the second Renyi mutual information in the MPS across the bond right of `site`
- `MI_matrix(mps)`: Computes the matrix of pairwise mutual information between the nodes

#### `linalg.py`

This file essentially only contains a costum singular value decomposition function which is able to handle tensors of any shape and allows from the trunctation of the singular value spectrum up to keeping a maximal of `Dmax` singular values above a fixed threshold set by `cutoff`.

### spinmodelTN

The spin model Tensor network library is still very much under development. It builds on the stochasticTN code base to create MPS and Tree Tensor Networks (TTN) for probability distributions over spin models with (arbitrary) higher-order interactions.
